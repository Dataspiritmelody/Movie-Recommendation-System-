# Movie Recommendation System

An interactive movie recommendation engine built with Python. This project allows users to search for a movie and receive ten personalized recommendations instantly.

##  Project Overview
In this project, I built an interactive movie recommendation system designed for real-world application. By entering a movie title and its release year, the system suggests a list of similar films you might enjoy. 

**Key Features:**
* **Search Engine:** Type a movie name (e.g., *Toy Story*) and get immediate results.
* **Recommendation Logic:** If you like *Toy Story*, the system will recommend titles like *Toy Story 2*, *A Bug's Life*, and *Monsters Inc.*
* **Data Science Workflow:** Includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and building a similarity-based recommendation engine.

##  Skills Learned
* Data cleaning and preparation.
* Creating a search box interface.
* Developing a recommendation algorithm.
* Python for Data Science.
